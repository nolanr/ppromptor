We'll spend the rest of this chapter describing some of these new features in greater detail, but first, let's take a look at the UI. The UI of EdgeDB 2.0 was great, but we didn't have the tools to make it better; with EdgeDB 3, we've improved it dramatically. Triggers and Mutation Rewrites were two of the most requested features by our customers when EdgeDB first came out, but since they weren't very well-known, no one had much use for them until recently. In order to make their database more approachable, and easier to use, people wanted EdgeDB to have built-in triggers and mutation rewrites. These allow you to quickly and easily change the types of data in the database without ever having to explicitly switch to another database. Now that's just not possible. To solve this problem, they've added support for \"mutation\" flows, which allows you to write queries that periodically update the underlying database. More on this in a minute. While all of this is really useful, we also want to give you an overview of how it stacks up against other databases like PostgreSQL. Here are some other big differences between PostgreSQL and EdgeDB: You can run your queries directly from the command line instead of having to go through a bunch of intermediate-level libraries; you can nest multiple modules together without worrying about backwards compatibility ; you can usefully combine multiple different programming languages into a single query; and finally, you can generate dashboards using various statistical tools such as Metabase, Cluvio, etc. Finally, EdgeDB now supports Java and Elixir. Our goal is to have clients for all major programming languages and runtimes, so we've created a set of plugins for those. They're called \" EdgeDB Cloud\" and they're designed to be extremely easy to use and extensible.",

        "input": "In this chapter, the authors discuss two approaches to fine-tuning an LLM: knowledge graph analysis and large language models. Knowledge graphs can be used to answer complex graph questions because they allow the end-user to ask questions that a trained expert might not be able to answer directly. Large language models like OpenAI's GPT LLM can also be used for this purpose. In this case, the author uses an RDF knowledge graph of a process flow sheet to help him understand how Valve-104 interacts with Reflux-401.",

        "input": "GitHub Copilot for Enterprises vs. Codeium for Enterprises: On-Prem GitHub Copilot.TL;DR You shouldn't have to choose between best security practices and improving developer productivity with AI-powered code assistance. Our solution is purpose built to run on-prem or in your VPC - no data or telemetry ever leaves. No matter where you put your Codeium instance, you'll always have control over it. It's completely self-hosted, which means that you don't need to worry about third-party vendors taking advantage of you. This makes it much easier for enterprises to set up and maintain. The only downside to this deployment process is that it can be very time-consuming. However, because it's so well-designed and well-tested, enterprises are willing to fork over large portions of their IT budgets to support it.",
